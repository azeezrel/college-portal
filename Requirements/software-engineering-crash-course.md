# Software Engineering Crash Course
*Hello,*

*We have come up with this document to explain the buzz words weâ€™ll be using a lot during this project.*

*We hope to make it as easy-to-understand as possible.*


## Requirement Specification

A requirements specification document gives a description of the conditions that need to exist and the objectives/goals that the software needs to meet for it to be said to solve the problem it was intended to solve.

Requirements Specification Documents are usually split into Functional and User Requirements:

* User Requirement

The User Requirements documents considers each possible User of the system, and lists all tasks that the user
would expect the software to perform on his/her behalf.

* Functional Requirement

The Functional Requirements documents considers each component, entity or sub-system within the software and
what tasks each will be expected to perform.


## Object Specification
This document considers each entity or component within the software, gives its description and its constituent parts (data and functions). E.g. a User is an entity, and may have an Id (number), firstName (string), lastName (string), etc.
